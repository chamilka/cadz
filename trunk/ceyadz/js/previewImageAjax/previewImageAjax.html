Description:
- This is a script to upload a form dynamically with Ajax, which contains an
  image and more data. The image is displayed in preview when it is selected.
- It consists of one html page and two php scripts. I wanted to do the
  funtionality of the first php script, which resizes the selected image,
  with Ajax instead of php. But it is not possible due to the limited action
  of JavaScript over the file field and the filesystem, because of security
  reasons. 
- There are actually two forms, one for the image and another for the rest
  of the data. (The reason is that JavaScript cannot take the selected file
  of the file field. It is explained some points below.) There is also an
  iframe which displays the image.
- The image form is automatically submited when a new file is selected. It is
  sent to a php script which resizes the image, stores it in a temporary 
  directory and displays it. The target of the image form is the iframe, so
  the image is displayed in it without need of reloading the whole page.
- The php script also writes in the iframe a control variable containing the
  temporary path of the uploaded image. This variable is key to dynamically
  upload the data form with Ajax.
- I wanted to do the resizing and previewing of the image with JavaScript,
  saving the submitting of the image form and the processing of the image
  at the server side. However it is not possible, because JavaScript cannot
  interact with the filesystem due to security reasons.
- Another handicap is that JavaScript can barely manage the file field, due
  to security reasons too. JavaScript can only read the name of the selected
  file but not the whole path. JavaScript can neither take the selected file
  to send it via Ajax. Thus, the file field cannot be sent via Ajax. The only
  way it can be sent is submitting the whole form. Therefore must be a
  separate form only for the file field, in order be able to submit only this 
  field and not the rest of the fields.
- The image form has another hidden field (for testing purpose it is visible)
  to store the name of the previous selected file, so it can be removed by
  the php script.
- The button to submit the data form takes the data fields and the control
  variable of the iframe, which says if there is an uploaded image and what
  its temporary path in the server is. A second php script is called, which
  moves the uploaded image from the temporary directory to the final one,
  and process the rest of the data.
  
Notes and improvements:
- This script has been tested with Firefox 3.0.10, Opera 9.64, Safari 4
  and Internet Explorer 6.0. Everything works fine (with the exception of
  the next point).
- The event "onchange" of the file field is well performed by all browsers
  when selecting a file with the button "browse". Firefox and Safari don't
  allow to write in the field, only to use the button to select a file.
  Explorer and Opera allow to write in the text box of the field. Explorer
  works fine and trhows the event "onchange" when the field loses the focus.
  Opera throws the event "onchange" everytime a key is pressed when typing
  in the field, what is not the desired behaviour.
- The file to upload must be validated with JavaScript previously to send
  it in the function uploadImage().
- If a file is sent, which is larger than the maximum size especified with
  the hidden field MAX_FILE_SIZE, PHP will throw an error, with error code
  2. To avoid such message and a futile sending, the file must be previously
  validated with JavaScript.
- In order to test the posible delays with the uploads, adjust the sleep
  statement in the function displayImage() in the file uploadImage.php.
  Adjust also the parameters in the JavaScript function submitForm().
- When an image is uploaded to the temporary directory to preview it, it is
  checked if there was a previously previewed image, to remove it from the
  temporary directory. However, the temporary directory must be emptied
  from time to time, because there will be files from the previewed images
  of forms that were finally not submited.
